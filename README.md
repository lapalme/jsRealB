# jsRealB - A JavaScript Bilingual Text Realizer for Web Development

## This version of jsRealB is no longer updated, please refer to [rali gibhub version](https://github.com/rali-udem/jsRealB)

*Version 4.5 - September 2022*

**This version is a major code reorganization of the system with JavaScript classes and modules.** This simplifies the internal organization of the code, but the syntactic formalism stays the same, possibly incurring a slight modification in the initial setup.

Natural Language Generation (NLG) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of systems that produce text for different applications, for example the textual description of massive datasets or the automation of routine text creation.

The web is constantly growing and its content, getting progressively more dynamic, is well-suited to automation by a realizer. However existing realizers are not designed with the web in mind and their integration in a web environment requires much knowledge, complicating their use.

**jsRealB is a text realizer designed specifically for the web**, easy to learn and to use. This realizer allows its user to build a variety of French and English expressions and sentences, to add HTML tags to them and to easily integrate them into web pages.

**jsRealB can also be used in Javascript application** by means of a `node.js` module available also as `npm` package. It also accepts an input specification in JSON. 

The documentation can be accessed [here](http://rali.iro.umontreal.ca/JSrealB/current/documentation/user.html). You can switch between English and French in the upper right corner of the page. The specification of the JSON input format is described [here](http://rali.iro.umontreal.ca/JSrealB/current/data/jsRealB-jsonInput.html).

The _companion_ project [pyrealb](https://github.com/lapalme/pyrealb) implements in Python a text realizer using the same notation for syntactic elements as `jsRealB`.

`jsRealB` can be used out of the box (the GitHub in fact!) in a web page by using `jsRealB.js` in the [`dist`](dist/) directory.

**Caution**
* [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org/) is necessary for the Javascript application examples.
* The current build process relies on the availability of [webpack](https://webpack.js.org).


## Directories
* [`Architecture`](Architecture/):
    * `README.md` : Description of the architecture of the system; the second section goes into details of the organization of the source files and describes the main methods.
* [`data`](data/):  lexicographic information that is bundled with the `dist/jsRealB.js`
    * `lexicon-en.json` : a *comprehensive* English lexicon (33926 entries) in JSON format 
    * `lexicon-fr.json` : a *comprehensive* French lexicon (52512 entries) in JSON format
    * `rule-en.js` : English conjugation and declension tables 
    * `rule-fr.js` : French conjugation and declension tables 
* [`demos`] : see next section
* [`dist`](dist/): pre-built JavaScript files ready for production use, they already include the English and French lexicons and the English and French rule tables
    * `jsRealB.js`: packages all .js files of the `build` directory as a module and exports only main functions and constants
        * For use in a web page : `<script src="/path/to/dist/jsRealB.js"></script>`
        * For use as a node.js module : `import jsRealB from  "/path/to/dist/jsRealB.js"`
    * `jsRealB-filter.js`: example of use of the node.js module to create a Unix filter for `jsRealB`
    * `jsRealB-server.js`: example of use of the node.js module to start a web server that realizes sentences
    * `testServer.py`: Python script using the `jsRealB` server
    * `package.json`: necessary for publishing the `jsrealb` *npm* package.  
    When a new version is to be put on `npm`, in principle, it should be enough to issue the two following commands from within the `dist` directory (after a npm login):  
      `npm version {major|minor|patch}`  
      `npm publish`  
    Because of the `.npmignore` hidden file in this directory, only `jsRealB.js` is published.
* [`documentation`](documentation/): in both English and French. The examples are generated on the fly by embedding `jsRealB` in the page. [*Consult the documentation*](http://rali.iro.umontreal.ca/JSrealB/current/documentation/user.html)
    * `jsRealBfromPython.html`: documentation for creating the JSON input format in Python
    * `user.html`: HTML of the core of the page (`div[id]` correspond to variables in `user-infos.js`)
    * `style.css`: style sheet
    * `user-infos.js`: definitions of variables containing the examples
    * `user.js`  : JavaScript helper script.
* [`Examples`](Examples): Examples of integration of jsRealB into web pages or node.js applications. See [index.html](Examples/index.html) for use cases.
* [`IDE`](IDE/) : An Integrated Development Environment built upon the `Node.js` *read-eval-print loop* that includes `jsRealB` to easily get the realization of an expression, to consult the lexicon, the conjugation and declination tables. It is also possible to get a *lemmatization*: i.e. the `jsRealB` expression corresponding to a form. See the [`README.html`](IDE/README.html) file to see how to use it.
* [`src`](src/): sources to create the JavaScript library; more details in the [document on the architecture of the system](Architecture/README.md) 
    * `jsdoc`: documentation directory of the source files of jsRealB.js. [Consult the documentation](src/index.html)
    * `Constituent.js`: *Constituent* is the top class for methods shared between *Phrase*s and *Terminal*s 
    * `Dependent.js` : subclass of *Constituent* for creating complex phrases using the *dependency notation* 
    * `JSON-tools.js` : functions for dealing with the JSON input format
    * `jsRealB.js` : _main_ module that gathers all exported symbols from other classes and exports them in a single list. It also defines other utility functions and constants
    * `Lexicon.js` : English and French lexicons with their associated functions  
    * `NonTerminal.js` : functions and constants that are shared between `Dependent.js` and `Phrase.js`
    * `Number.js` : utility functions for number formatting
    * `Phrase.js` : subclass of *Constituent* for creating complex phrases using the _constituent notation_
    * `Terminal.js` : subclass of *Constituent* for creating a single unit (most often a single word)
    * `Warnings.js` : list of functions to generate warnings in case of erroneous specifications using jsRealB itself
* [`Tests`](Tests/) : unit tests (using [QUnit](https://qunitjs.com "QUnit")) of jsRealB in both French and English.

* *Files in the current directory*:
    * `tests-dev.js` : node.js application that loads `jsRealB.js` from the `dist` directory and an internal script that displays the realization of a few examples. 
    * `README.md` : this file
    * `package.json` : file with parameters for building jsRealB using `npm` using

  The system first computes the critical path to find the start and end times of each task. It then creates a graphic for displaying the PERT diagram and an accompanying text to explain the steps to follow. It is possible to interactively change the start date and to explore the graphic with the mouse which also uses jsRealB to generate the text of the tooltips.

## Design of the system
The current version (4.5) is a redesign and reimplementation of the previous version while keeping intact the external interface, i.e. same name of functions for building constituents, for option names and for global functions. This means that applications using only the external interface of `jsRealB` can be run unchanged. Version 4.0 added the dependency notation.

[This document](Architecture/README.md) first describes the transformation steps within the realizer using a few examples. It then gives an overview of the implementation explaining the role of the main classes and methods.

## Authors
jsRealB was updated, developed and brought to its current version by [Guy Lapalme](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lapalme) building on the work of:

1. [Francis Gauthier](http://www-etud.iro.umontreal.ca/~gauthif) as part of his summer internship at RALI in 2016; 
2. [Paul Molins](http://paul-molins.fr/) as part of an internship from INSA Lyon spent at RALI, University of Montreal in 2015;
3. [Nicolas Daoust](mailto:n@daou.st) developed the original concept in the _JSreal_ realizer for French only in 2013.
